# headstage_cap
3D printable files of the three component cap to protect the neural headstage.

The cap consists of:
- a base and defines a minimal oval window enclosing the electrodes, that morphs to a circular aperture on the top; after implanting the electrodes,
- a middle component to be glued to the base with epoxy resin during surgery.
- a top component, to be screwed onto the middle one for easy access to the headstage.

The cap was designed with a smooth surface to avoid any accidental opening in the cage, and to maximise comfort.
