      <ul>
        <li>a top component, to be screwed onto the middle one for easy access to the headstage.</li>
        <li>a middle component to be glued to the base with epoxy resin during surgery.</li>
        <li>a base that starts with a minimal oval window enclosing the electrodes, morphing to a circular aperture on the top; after implanting the electrodes,</li>
